Thus the Lord is transcendental to all material contamination. Unto Him only must one surrender.

Therefore you are advised to engage in the devotional service of Kṛṣṇa, the son of Vasudeva.

Although the ocean is difficult to cross, by taking shelter of His lotus feet you will overcome all dangers.
