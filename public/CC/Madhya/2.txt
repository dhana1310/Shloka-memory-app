“The palms of Kṛṣṇa’s hands and the soles of His feet are so cool and pleasant that they can be compared only to the light of millions of moons. One who has touched such hands and feet has indeed tasted the effects of touchstone. If one has not touched them, his life is spoiled, and his body is like iron.”

Such love of Godhead acts in two ways. The poisonous effects of love of Godhead defeat the severe and fresh poison of the serpent. Yet there is simultaneously transcendental bliss, which pours down and defeats the pride of nectar and diminishes its value. In other words, love of Kṛṣṇa is so powerful that it simultaneously defeats the poisonous effects of a snake, as well as the happiness derived from pouring nectar on one’s head. It is perceived as doubly effective, simultaneously poisonous and nectarean.’ ”

Whatever little I have heard from Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī I have described in this book, which is presented to all devotees.

bhāgavata — Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam; śloka-maya — full of Sanskrit verses; ṭīkā — commentaries; tāra — of that; saṁskṛta — Sanskrit language; haya — there are; tabu — still; kaiche — how; bujhe — understands; tri-bhuvana — the whole world; ihāṅ — in this; śloka — verses; dui cāri — a few; tāra — of them; vyākhyā — explanation; bhāṣā — in simple language; kari — I do; kene — why; nā — not; bujhibe — will understand; sarva-jana — all people.

Translation
In reply to those critics who say that Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta is full of Sanskrit verses, it can be said that Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is also full of Sanskrit verses, as are the commentaries on Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Nonetheless, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam can be understood by everyone, as well as by advanced devotees who study the Sanskrit commentaries. Why, then, will people not understand the Caitanya-caritāmṛta? There are only a few Sanskrit verses, and these have been explained in the Bengali vernacular. What is the difficulty in understanding?
